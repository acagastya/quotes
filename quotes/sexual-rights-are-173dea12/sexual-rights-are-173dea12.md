# *[S]exual rights are a part of human rights; these are not minor rights, small boons that we can do without.  To practise one's sexual citizenship, to do with our bodies as we see fit, to lead a sex life without risk, one that brings pleasure and is free from coercion: these are fundamental needs and rights that ought to be inalienable and guaranteed for all.*
