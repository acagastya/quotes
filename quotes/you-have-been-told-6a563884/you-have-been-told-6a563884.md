# *You have been told that, even like a chain, you are as weak as your weakest link.*
## *This is but half the truth.  You are also as strong as your strongest link.*
## *To measure you by your smallest deed is to reckon the power of ocean by the frailty of its foam.*
## *To judge you by your failures is to cast blame upon the seasons for their inconsistency.*
